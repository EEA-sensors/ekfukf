Title: Kalman filters
Description: EKF/UKF is an optimal filtering toolbox. Optimal filtering is a
  frequently used term for a process, in which the state of a
  dynamic system is estimated through noisy and indirect measurements. This
  toolbox mainly consists of Kalman filters and smoothers, which are the most
  common methods used in stochastic state-space estimation. The purpose of the
  toolbox is not to provide a highly optimized software package, but instead to
  provide a simple framework for building proof-of-concept implementations of
  optimal filters and smoothers to be used in practical applications.
